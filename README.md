# **Recipe Search**

This project was my first attempt at learning JavaScript. It's a simple project where a user can search for any recipe
designed and tested on other website like All Recipes, Real Simple and BBC Good Food to name a few.

## Features of the site include:

* The ability to dynamically increase the amount of ingredients needed by increasing the serving size
* The ability to bookmark a recipe
* The ability to add your own recipes

## 🚀 Skills I acquired from this project:

### JavaScript Fundamentals

    DOM Manipulation
    Event Handling
    Async/Await

### UI Interactivity

    Dynamic Content Rendering
    Responsive Layout design

## **This is the final version of the site**
